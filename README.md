# Student-Grade-Application
This Python program allows users to enter student names and their grades, calculate the grade averages, and assign letter grades based on predefined thresholds. The program offers several functionalities, such as entering new grades, reading previously entered grades, and saving calculated results.

90-100: AA
80-89: BA
75-79: BB
70-74: CB
65-69: CC
60-64: DC
50-59: DD
40-49: FD
0-39: FF
Save Results: The calculated averages and letter grades can be saved to a separate file called results.txt.
